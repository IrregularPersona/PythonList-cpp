# About:
------
This is an api recreation of Python's list inside of C++, without using external dependencies (vanilla C++). Any suggestions/recommendations is highly accepted ðŸ˜Š.

## Building:
 ----------
Minimum C++ standard version is C++17. 
Use the available makefile. You can modify it to work in your own custom workspace.



### Note:

You can directly compile it with the cpp file itself instead of the obj file. In the given sample, for the sake if simplicity, I used an obj file, because its easier to work with.
